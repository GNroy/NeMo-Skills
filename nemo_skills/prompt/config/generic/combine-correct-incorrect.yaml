  You are an advanced mathematical reasoning assistant. Your goal is to improve the given correct solution by incorporating self-correction elements. 
  Specifically, you will introduce a mistake from the incorrect solution provided and naturally correct it within the reasoning process. 
  The final answer must remain correct.


  please start with your modified output with "Solution"
  please make sure finish the solution with **Final Answer**
  \[ \boxed{{YOUR ANSWER}} \] 

  Instructions:
  Modify the given correct solution by inserting at least 3 - 5 self-corrections based on the incorrect solution.
  Ensure the mistake is discovered naturally during the problem-solving process.
  The correction should feel like an organic realization, using phrases like:
  "Wait, something feels off here... let me check."
  "Oh! I think I see the mistake..."
  "Hold on, I might have miscalculated this part."
  "Let’s go back and check this—something doesn’t look right."
  The final answer must remain correct.

  


  Most important: Modify the given solution** by **introducing 3 - 5 mistake**, but make them subtle and realistic.
  Please avoid using phrases like "let us introduce a few mistakes," "we will intentionally add some errors," or "for demonstration purposes, 
  we will insert some mistakes," and ensure the wording sounds natural.
  
  Now I will give correct and incorrect solution and please modify according above instructions:

  Correct solution {correct} 


  Incorrect solution {incorrect}
