  You are analyzing forum posts where each problem is associated with a list of discussions. Each discussion may contain a correct answer or might not. Your task is to:

  Understand the Problem: Carefully read the problem statement, which includes:

   1. Question Text: The full text of the question.
      Thanks Received: A number indicating how many users appreciated the question (e.g., Thanks Received: 1).
      No Thanks Received: A number indicating how many users found the question unhelpful (e.g., No Thanks Received: 0).
      A higher "Thanks Received" value for the question indicates that it is of higher quality and importance. 

  2. Evaluate Individual Discussions: Analyze each discussion, which contains:
     Text: The content of the discussion.
     Thanks Received: A number indicating how many users appreciated this discussion.
     No Thanks Received: A number indicating how many users found this discussion unhelpful.
     Discussions with a higher "Thanks Received" and fewer "No Thanks Received" are generally more valuable.

  3. Understand the Discussion Metrics: In addition to the details of each discussion, the following aggregate metrics for all discussions are provided:
     Total Thanks Received: The sum of all "Thanks Received" values across all discussions.
     Total No Thanks Received: The sum of all "No Thanks Received" values across all discussions.
     These totals provide a general indication of the level of engagement and sentiment about the entire set of discussions.

  4. Extract Correct Answers: Identify and extract the correct answers (if any) from the discussions. Trt to prioritize those with:
     Higher "Thanks Received."
     Lower "No Thanks Received."
     Contextual relevance to the problem.
  
  Format the Answers: Output the extracted correct answers (if any) in \boxed{{}} notation. If no correct answers are found, state "No correct answer found."
  
   Here are a few examples. 


   Example 1:
   Forum post:
   "Question Text: Billy Bob has fourteen different pairs of socks in his drawer. They are just thrown around randomly in the drawer. Billy Bob once woke up in a hurry and had to get his socks quickly. Without switching the light on, he pulled out enough socks to know that he had at least one pair, and then he ran out of the room. How many socks did Billy Bob pull out?\n

   Discussion Text: the answer is 15 because if bob picks 14 different socks, the 15th one is obviously going to be the same as one of the 14 different socks. \r\nBy the way, what's the pigeonhole property? (Sorry I'm kind of new to this)\nThanks Received: 2\nNo Thanks Received: 0\n\n

   Your response:
   The most robust reasoning is presented in Discussion 3:
   Pigeonhole: If there are If there are $kn+1$ objects in $kn$ boxes, there must be one box with at least $k+1$ objects in it. 
   You have $14$ boxes for the $14$ pairs of socks. We want at least $2$ socks in one of the boxes. So, in this case: \[k = 1, \quad n = 14, \quad kn+1 = 15.\]

   Thus, the number of socks Billy Bob must pull out is \(\boxed{{15}}\).

   Discussion Text: [hide]When $2006!$ is divided by any thing from $1$ to $2005$, the result will always be greater than $2005!$, because when it is divided by 2006, it will equal $2005!$.

   Your response:

   After analyzing the forum post and its discussions, I have extracted the most accurate answer:\n\n\\boxed{2005}\n\nThis answer is supported by multiple discussions (1, 2, 4, and 5) with a high number of \"Thanks Received\" and no \"No Thanks Received\". 
   The discussions provide clear explanations and reasoning for why the answer is 2005. Discussion 3 also confirms the correctness of the answer.\n\n
   Therefore, I present the extracted correct answer in the format \\boxed{{2005}}."

   Your task is to analyze the provided forum post and its discussion, extract the most accurate answer, and present it in the format \boxed{{}}.
