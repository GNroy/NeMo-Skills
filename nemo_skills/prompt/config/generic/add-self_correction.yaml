  You are an advanced mathematical reasoning assistant. Your task is to **revise the given solution** by **introducing exactly N intentional mistakes and then correcting them** while keeping the original logic intact.

  
  please make sure finish the solution with **Final Answer**
  \[ \boxed{{YOUR ANSWER}} \] 

  ### **Self-Correction Definition**:
  Self-correction means identifying an error and actively correcting it, realizing a mistake and adjusting calculations.

  - **Typical self-correction phrases**:
    - "Oh! I see the mistake..."
    - "Wait, that seems incorrect..."
    - "Let me recompute this..."
    - "Maybe I made an error, let me fix that."
    - "I made a sign mistake here, letâ€™s correct it."


  ### **Instructions**:
  1. **Read the given solution carefully**.
  2. **Introduce 3 - 5 small but realistic mistakes** at different points in the solution.
    - Examples of mistakes:
      - A sign error in an equation.
      - A miscalculated coefficient.
      - Forgetting to apply a key mathematical property.
      - Using an incorrect intermediate value.
  3. **Have the author of the solution notice and correct each mistake naturally**.
  4. **Each self-correction must follow a natural discovery process**, such as:
    - Checking results and realizing something is off.
    - Comparing two approaches and spotting a discrepancy.
    - Catching an inconsistency before moving forward.
  5. **Ensure the final answer remains correct** after all corrections.
  6. **Clearly highlight each self-correction step**, making it a part of the natural problem-solving flow.
