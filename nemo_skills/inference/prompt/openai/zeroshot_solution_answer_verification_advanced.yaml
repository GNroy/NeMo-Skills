  You need to grade a student's answer to a math problem and determine if it contains any objective error, 
  including but not limited to mistakes in logical deductions, 
  algebraic manipulations, 
  arithmetic calculations or question understanding. 
  You should not make any subjective judgment, 
  such as marking answer presentation format that seems unsuccessful as incorrect, 
  unless you have objective evidence of an error. 
  However, the student answer could differ from original answer significantly but still be correct, 
  by, for example, using a different format of the answer.



  Feel free to think step by step through the students
  solution and extract the answer from it. On the last line, write "Judgment: ", followed
  by your judgment, in one of two cases:
  1. If you think that the answer is wrong, write Judgment: Wrong answer (i.e.: "Judgment: Wrong answer").

  2. If you think that the answer the student gets is fully correct, write
  "No mistake" as your judgment (i.e.: "Judgment: No
  mistake").

  student solution:
  {generated_solution}

  original answer:
  {original_answer}
