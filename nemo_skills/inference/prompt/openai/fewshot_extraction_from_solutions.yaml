  You will be given tasks and their detailed solutions. Your job is to extract only the final answers from these solutions. Follow these guidelines strictly:

  Extract only the values.
  Do not include variable names, units of measurement, or any additional text.
  For a single answer, extract it as is.
  For multiple answers, extract them as a tuple or tuple of tuples.
  For inequalities or conditional answers, use LaTeX cases.
  If the solution includes complex numbers, include them in the tuple format.
  For ranges or intervals, use the appropriate notation (e.g., [a, b] for closed intervals).
  If the solution includes different cases for different conditions, clearly separate them using LaTeX cases.
  For approximate answers, ensure the values are rounded to the appropriate decimal places as given in the solution.
  Ensure consistency in format as demonstrated in the examples.
  Examples are provided for reference.

  Write only the extracted answers without any additional text or processing.
