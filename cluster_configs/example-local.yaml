# add required mounts for models/data here
# the code is mounted automatically inside /nemo_run/code
# but please note that we only package what's tracked by git + jsonl files inside nemo_skills/dataset

# mounts:
# you can define as many as you need, e.g.
#   - /mnt/datadrive/models:/models
#   - /mnt/datadrive/data:/data
#   - /home/<username>/workspace:/workspace

# Environment variables.
# You can configure how the executor handles environment variables like this
# env_vars:
#  - MYENVVAR  # will pick the value from env
#  - MYENVVAR2=my_value  # will use my_value
#  - HYDRA_FULL_ERROR=1 # This one is useful for debugging
#  - HF_HOME=<path to a mounted folder which links to your HF_cache> # This allows you to reuse the hf cache in
#                                                                    #  your host

# Mandatory environment variables:
# If you need a job to fail when a variable is not defined then add them to the required_env_vars section
# required_env_vars:
#  - MY_ALL_IMPORTANT_BEHAVIOR_CHANGING_VAR
